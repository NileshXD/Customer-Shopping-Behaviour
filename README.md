📊 Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Business Insights
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data ingestion, exploratory analysis, data cleaning, database integration using SQL and PostgreSQL, and interactive visualization through Power BI. The objective is to extract actionable insights from raw data and present them in a clear, decision-friendly format.

🎯 Objectives

Load and analyze raw data using Python

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and anomalies

Clean and preprocess data for accurate analysis

Store and query data using SQL and PostgreSQL

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Database: PostgreSQL

Query Language: SQL

Visualization: Power BI

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, pgAdmin
